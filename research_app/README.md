A toy notebook-like app to show how to use 'cells' to do something interesting.

run

    research_app/whole_system_simulation.py

with the typed-python codebase and the root of 'research_app' in your PYTHONPATH,
and connect with a browser to localhost:8000

In another terminal, you can run

    ./redeploy.py redeploy --watch

and it will redeploy the app any time a source file changes.
